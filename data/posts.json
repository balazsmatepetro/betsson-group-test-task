        "description": "<h3>Costa renaissance continues under Hiddink</h3><p>Chelsea’s resurgence under Guus Hiddink continued last weekend with a 2-0 win over lowly Scunthorpe. The much maligned Diego Costa continued his goal scoring run in the game, making it four in his last four (excluding midweek v West Brom). Chelsea are 13 points off the top four but a good run could see them back in contention.</p><h3>Arsenal gunning to keep top spot</h3><p>Stoke City have one of the most dynamic forward lines in the Premier League and have looked like world beaters against some of the big boys this season. Their form against the teams around them is what’s let them down. Recent wins against both Manchester clubs were sandwiched in between losses to Sunderland, Crystal Palace and West Brom.</p>",

        "description": "<h3>Can Inter bounce back against Atalanta?</h3><p>t is one of the less renowned derbies in Italy however this Lombardian clash will be a real test of Inter’s resolve. Roberto Mancini’s men suffered an unexpected setback to Sassuolo last weekend, losing 1-0 in front of their home crowd courtesy of Domenico Berardi’s last minute penalty. In truth, had Inter not encountered an inspired Andrea Consigli – who made one of the saves of the season to deny Adem Ljajic – then they would have likely come away with at least a draw. Inter’s dismay was accentuated by the fact that they dropped to third after Napoli and Juventus both won.In the past, the Nerazzurri have struggled against Atalanta and even went six games without beating their provincial rivals between 2011 and 2014. However, the Orobici are on a run of four consecutive losses, managing only two goals in the process. Mancini’s men won’t be too concerned about how they get the job done in Bergamo, but their capability of grinding out a result has been demonstrated time and again this season. Expect a cagey affair and perhaps Inter’s tenth 1-0 victory of the season.</p><h3>Napoli and Juventus to continue their fine form</h3><p>Top of the table Napoli host Sassuolo on Saturday night while second placed Juventus travel to Udinese the following day. On paper, Napoli look to have the trickier fixture. Sassuolo have already proved their credentials against Italy’s finest and are yet to lose against one of the current top five. In the reverse fixture, they held Napoli in an entertaining 2-2 draw, however this will be a different game in front of a raucous and expectant Stadio San Paolo. There is no doubt the Neroverdi will cause their hosts problems, but they will need a repeat </p>",

        "description": "<h3>Inter face tough trip to Empoli</h3><p>Inter topped Serie A over Christmas however their festive joy was tempered by a 2-1 defeat at home to Lazio before the break. A trip to Empoli will be another stern test for Roberto Mancini’s title pretenders. Empoli coach, Marco Giampaolo, has worked wonders since taking over from Maurizio Sarri and the Tuscans currently sit in eighth position, just one point behind the European places. The Azzurri have achieved this playing an entertaining brand of football and are perhaps one of the best passing sides in the league. This was exemplified in their most recent victory over Bologna, in which Empoli scored a contender for goal of the season, top-scorer Massimo Maccarone rounding off a beautiful team move. Behind the veteran forward, the creativity of Zielinski, Saponara and Paredes will ensure that Inter have their hands full. Indeed, the Nerazzurri will need to rediscover their defensive resilience should they wish to start the New Year with a victory.</p><h3>Expect wins for the chasing pack</h3><p>Second-placed Fiorentina travel to Palermo on Wednesday afternoon knowing that a win could send them top ahead of Inter’s trip to Empoli. Having won just three of their nine home games this season, Palermo find themselves dangerously close to the relegation zone. With no injury concerns for Fiorentina coach Paulo Sousa, the Viola will be confident of kick-starting their 2016 with a win.</p>",

Following an impressive start to the season which had the Londoners being touted as potential European contenders, a run of eight games without a win left Slaven Billic’s men in mid table. A win here and they’re right back in contention.Liverpool have flattered to deceive since the appointment of Jurgen Klopp. At times they’ve looked like title challengers while losses to the likes of Crystal Palace at home has seen their league position stagnate. Wednesday night’s game against Sunderland may be a factor in deciding this one as the Red’s will have had less recovery time.</p><h3>Ozil in rich vein of form</h3><p>Arsenals title credentials hit a road block with a 4-0 loss to Southampton last weekend but a win over Bournemouth on Monday moved them to the leagues summit. Mesut Ozil has played a huge part in their title push and has added three goals to his 16 assists this season.Newcastle continue to move closer to playing Championship football next season. Only four wins all season and one of the leagues leakiest defences has given their fans little cause for optimism. A loss to the league leaders this weekend will see them fall further out of touch with the teams above them. Mesut Ozil has arguably been the league’s best player this year and is 3.75 to win PFA Player of the year.</p>",

A huge 1,804 players entered, comfortably making it the biggest tournament ever played on the island of Malta. The €874,940 prize pool also came in way above its €500,000 guarantee.</p><p>In an unusual turn of events on the final day, a deal was made between the final three players guaranteeing each of them over €100,000. What was strange about this however was that Hendrick Koops, the third place Norwegian finisher actually went home with a bigger cheque than both the winner and runner up, due having a huge chip lead when the deal was made. “That’s why you make a deal�?, were his words as he left the table on elimination with a cheque for €125,000.</p><p>Since the Battle of Malta’s inception in 2012 Betsson.com have proudly sponsored the event and as such we were delighted when Betsson player Michael Joseph Bray cashed in 19th place taking home €4,110. Bray’s play highlighted the calibre of players currently playing with Betsson Poker and hopefully next year we will see a few more going deep at the event.</p><p>Once again the Battle of Malta> exceeded all expectations and there is no doubt it will continue to grow for years to come.

It brought an end to a run of three consecutive wins. The ‘Citizens’ have won the last four meetings between these sides scoring 12 goals in the process. Swansea’s poor form continued last weekend, losing 3-0 away to Leicester. Speculation has continued to surround manager Garry Monk’s position. No wins since Oct 24 has left the Swan’s just one point above the relegation zone.</p><h3>Newcastle turn it around</h3><p>Spurs have looked solid so far this season and picked up a valuable away point to West Brom last weekend. Fifth in the league and unbeaten in eight games, the Champions League is certainly within reach for Pochettino’s side. A 2-0 win over Liverpool last weekend saw Newcastle leapfrog rivals Sunderland and up to 18th in the league. That was their first win in five games and eased the pressure on manager Steve McClaren.</p><h3>Leicester flying high</h3><p>Those were the words of Sir Alex Ferguson when asked about Leicester’s form this season. A crazy notion, or is it. Not many people would have predicted their current position when ex manager Nigel Pearson was sacked last season after narrowly avoiding relegation. Last season’s Champions could hardly have predicted their current situation either. Just two points above the relegation zone in what has surely been the weakest defence of the Premier League title in modern history. A loss to new boys Bournemouth last weekend just about summed up Chelsea’s season in 90 minutes.</p>",
